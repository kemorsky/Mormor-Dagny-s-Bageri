# Mormor Dagny's Bageri

This project has been written in collaboration with the backend department. It was created to digitalize the custom library of a bakery business owned by the client (internship granter) and act as a web application desployed to his workers.

The project has been written in C# and .NET for the backend, which is accessed through MySQL Workbench. The repository is private and can't be shared here.

The team had no designated UI/UX designer, nor specific instructions left by the client and as such was not the primary goal of the project. Data storage, navigation, and management across the linked frontend and backend and its API routes, was.

The Front End has been built with:

- React for design management and comfort
- React Router for easy navigation between elements
- Tailwind CSS for easy and comfortable styling
